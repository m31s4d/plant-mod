# Plant-Research-Models

Hello world,
with this project we aim to create a library to combine all current plant models for use in elementary research. The start will be the Farquhar Photosythesis Model described here (https://biocycle.atmos.colostate.edu/shiny/photosynthesis/). The implementation will be done in Python (V3.8).
